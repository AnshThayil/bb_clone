# bb_clone


This is a project to help familiarize myself with the Django Web Development framework.
This web app is trying to clone the functionality of the [Boulder Book](https://www.boulder-book.com/) application for setting and sharing boulders on a climbing gym's spam training wall.

To run the development server locally-

* Make sure you have Python and Django installed on your system.
* Clone and `cd` into the repository's root folder.
* Run `python manage.py runserver`
